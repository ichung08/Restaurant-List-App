# Restaurant List Application



## Project Description

The restaurant list application will contain a list of restaurants that a user can manipulate. 
Restaurants can be added, removed, and sorted. Within each specific restaurant, a user can give 
it a description, an address, assign it a rating, and add tags to it (eg. *cuisine, location,* or *price*). 
Additionally, this application will be able to randomly generate a restaurant as a suggestion for a place to eat. 
This random selection of restaurant will be chosen based off user selected cuisine, location, and/or price.

This restaurant list application can be used by anyone who wants to simply keep track of their favourite
restaurants in an easy way or by people who cannot decide on a restaurant to eat at. The main interest behind this 
project stems from my desire to keep track of restaurants I like eating at. I am a bit of a food enthusiast, and prior 
to COVID, I would occasionally travel around Richmond and Vancouver looking for restaurants and unique dishes to try. 
An additional interest behind this project is my desire to have a method of deciding a restaurant to eat at when
my friends are being especially indecisive. With a random restaurant generator, I'll be able to quickly choose a 
restaurant in those situations.
